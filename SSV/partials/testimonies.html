It was an unforgottable memory for me not only because I have visited several world-class tech company, but also made many new friends from different countries. Specifically, I really love the entrepreneurial atmosphere at SJSU as well as sillicon valley. The special culture there combines technology and business sense and aspires to make a difference in the world. I really appreciate that trip, and I will always remember the lesson learned in that summer.</p>

                                    <p style="margin-left:12cm">Summer in Silicon Valley had a great impact on me. In one respect, they arranged some lectures and field trips which broadened the horizons of SSV students especially me, a student majoring in Software Engineering. On the other hand, I didn’t only develop a good sense of team spirit and responsible attitude, but also made friends from Taiwan, America, Japan and Saudi Arabia.</p>

                                    <p style="margin-left:12cm">SSV is really worth to experiencing. I participated in the SSV with people from other places last summer and it was really an experience worth remembering.I had a deep visiting in many well-known companies in silicon valley like Intel, Cisco,EAG and so on. And many speeches about enterprising and innovation are also educational. Additionally, what impressed me most is the process to design and launch an IT product with teammates from different countries with diverse backgrounds. Take my team as an example, our teammates are from China, Taiwan and Saudi Arabia and some major in business while others major in engineering and information technology. In three weeks, we had to cooperate with each other and unit various knowledge to generate an innovative product and present it to public with powerpoint. What we created was a smart bracelet that can detect emotions and do relative reactions to make people happy. In the period, communicating was a big problem for us because none of us was English native speaker and we didn’t know other’s language at all.But it really engaged our ability to express ourselves clearly in patient in creative ways not just language. Of course, I learnt exotic culture and tradition a lot.When we fulfilled the goal eventually, I felt proud and moved for myself and my team. Can you imagine that we were just strangers three weeks ago and after these weeks we worked out a product together! So amazing to meet these guys to learn and create together in SSV! I recommend to take part in SSV and you will have a wonderful summer.</p>

That was my first visit to US, so I felt quite nervous and exciting when arrival. But teachers and team leaders there were tropical and affable, weather in CA was impressively good, and activities in the project were plentiful. They brought us to some companies in Silicon Valley, which left me a unforgettable impression. Until today, I am willing to work in Silicon Valley, because it is the forefront of the technology all over the world, also because its working environment was neat and creative, which gave me such a brand new sight.</p>
